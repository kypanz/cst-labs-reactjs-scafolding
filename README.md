# cst-labs-reactjs-scafolding

This script is created with the propose of create folders and files in Reactjs projects

I decide to create this script because i wanna follow some structure defined on the project

To use this script is very simple, currently only supports three folders, but can be exteneded depends of the project that you are building

## Requirements

- Put the file in the main of the project ( this gonna take the `./` like the root folder )
- Add the file to the .gitignore file


## Where the files are created ?
The files are created inside the `./src` folder

## Usage

Create a components folder + file
```
./cst new component [name]
```

Create a utils folder + file
```
./cst new util [name]
```

Create a redux slice folder + file
```
./cst new slice [name]
```
